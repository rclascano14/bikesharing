## Overview of Statistical Analysis

For this project, I have used the data visualization software of Tableau to present a business proposal for a bike-sharing company. While the dataset is from Citi Bike records of New York City, I will be utilizing this dataset to propose and visualize key data regarding the usage of Citi Bikes in Des Moines.

## Results

- Men make up the vast majority of Citi Bike users. 
- The peak for checkout times for men is at 5 minutes, whereas with women it is 7 minutes.

- The majority of weekday rides take place around 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM, which is when most individuals start and stop work respectively.
- When it comes to weekend rides, the number of trips remain high from 10:00 AM to 7:00 PM.




### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

- Once again, there are far more trips taken by men. 
- The aforementioned trend in times remains consistent, with both men and women peaking from 7-9AM and 5-7PM on weekdays and 10AM-7PM on weekends.
- There are not differences in the hours of trip choice by men and women and the only discrepancy between them is the far higher number of men with trips.




### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

- There are far more Subscriber users than Customer users. 
- Customer users tends to take most of their rides on the weekend. 
- Subscriber user trips tend to be far more evenly spread across the week, especially in the case of women.

- The vast majority of Citi Bike users are Subscribers as opposed to Customers. 


## Summary

Throughout this statistical analysis, I have found that the majority of the Citi Bike users are male, the peak hours are 7-9AM. As the Visualizations of the NYC Citi Bike Dataset indicates, Des Moines should make a good fit for Citi Bikes to expand business to the city.
