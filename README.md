## Overview of Statistical Analysis

For this project, I have used the data visualization software of Tableau to present a business proposal for a bike-sharing company. While the dataset is from Citi Bike records of New York City, I will be utilizing this dataset to propose and visualize key data regarding the usage of Citi Bikes in Des Moines.

## Results

### Checkout Times for Users

- This visualization shows the duration at which Bike Users checkout. 
- The checkout times of bikers peaks at 6 minutes with 145,147 users.
- Checkout times of users remain high, until around 45 minutes of trip duration. 



### Checkout Times by Gender

- Men make up the vast majority of Citi Bike users. 
- The peak for checkout times for men is at 5 minutes, whereas with women it is 7 minutes.



### Trips by Weekday for each Hour

- The majority of weekday rides take place around 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM, which is when most individuals start and stop work respectively.
- When it comes to weekend rides, the number of trips remain high from 10:00 AM to 7:00 PM.




### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
<img width="1176" alt="Module 14 Visualization 4" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95828604/160261155-f0367046-6b51-49b9-af58-7aaf6755c3f1.png">

- Once again, there are far more trips taken by men. 
- The aforementioned trend in times remains consistent, with both men and women peaking from 7-9AM and 5-7PM on weekdays and 10AM-7PM on weekends.
- There are not differences in the hours of trip choice by men and women and the only discrepancy between them is the far higher number of men with trips.




### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

- There are far more Subscriber users than Customer users. 
- Customer users tends to take most of their rides on the weekend. 
- Subscriber user trips tend to be far more evenly spread across the week, especially in the case of women. 




### August Peak Hours

- The hours of least activity are 2:00AM-5:00AM and the hours of peak activity are 5:00PM-7:00PM.




### Customers

- The vast majority of Citi Bike users are Subscribers as opposed to Customers. 


## Summary

Throughout this statistical analysis, I have found that the majority of the Citi Bike users are male and subcribers, that the peak hours are 7-9AM and 5-7PM on weekdays and 10AM-7PM on weekends for these users and lastly, that the average ride is 6 minutes. As the Visualizations of the NYC Citi Bike Dataset indicates, Des Moines should make a good fit for Citi Bikes to expand business to the city. However, while my findings in this analysis do not warrant any reason not to bring business to Des Moines, I can still think of two Visualization ideas to further prove the efficacy of Des Moines Citi Bikes. One would be a visualization detailing weather and temperatures in New York City. A quick google search will show that weather between New York City and Des Moines is incredibly similar. Consequently, by analyzing ride patterns with different temperatures in NYC, you could apply these same findings to Des Moines. Another Visualization idea would be expand the Peak Hours Visualization to all months of the year to get a comprehensive view of Citi Bike usage across a typical year.
